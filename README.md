### i3-scripts

I use these + rofi to handle window switching. \
Although in principal you can use them to 
apply any valid i3 command to a selected window.

The scripts expect to found in the PATH
(you may need to set it via: ~/.xsessionrc for i3 to see it)

```bash
i3-get-window-id.sh
i3-window-apply.sh
i3-window-switcher.sh
i3-workspace-window-list.sh
```
